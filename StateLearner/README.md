# CS-6490 Final Project

This project is building off of the work of jderuiter's statelearner. The original commit is completely their work and we have built off of it in an attempt to improve the fuzzers performance. We test OpenSSL version 1.1.0g, which was not tested in their implementation.

This folder contains the link to original research as well as patches the install and use older version of OpenSSL.

## Usage

Move into the statelearner-master directory for detailed README on how to run the tools.
